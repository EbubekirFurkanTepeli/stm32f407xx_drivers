# STM32f407xx_Drivers


This repository explains the bare-metal driver development process for the STM32F407VGT6 microcontroller. All drivers are implemented entirely in C, without relying on HAL or CMSIS libraries.

The purpose of this project is to gain a deep understanding of the STM32 architecture, learn peripheral register-level programming, and develop reusable low-level drivers suitable for professional embedded systems development.

The repository currently includes drivers for GPIO, SPI, USART, and I2C peripherals. Each driver module is tested through experiments designed to validate core functionality and demonstrate integration with other modules.

This repository serves both as a learning archive for embedded systems enthusiasts and as a professional portfolio showcasing low-level driver development skills.
